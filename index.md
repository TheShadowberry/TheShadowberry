# Etoile: Too Angry To Die

Welcome to the wonderful world of Etoile! Here we get punched in the face really hard and shrug it off like it's nothing!

## Unlocking Etoile

Just like Phantom and Hero, Etoile is a Successor class. This means it cannot take a subclass, and requires you to have the title for having 2 classes at level 75 to complete the client order "Etoile Class Unlocking Trial" from Koffie. However, like Phantom, Etoile can be used as a subclass for all the old classes to give massive defense bonuses.
